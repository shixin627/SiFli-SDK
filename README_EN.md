# SiFli-SDK

English | [中文](README.md)

## Getting Started

The SiFli SDK is an official software development framework, custom-built on RT-Thread, that enables rapid development of applications running on SiFli Technology’s chip platforms.

Relevant documentation:
- https://wiki.sifli.com/
- https://docs.sifli.com/projects/sdk/latest/sf32lb52x/index.html

You can refer to these documents for a quick start.

**Note**: Since the SDK includes submodules, you must clone the repository with the `--recursive` flag, for example:
```bash
git clone --recursive https://github.com/OpenSiFli/SiFli-SDK
```

The software framework is illustrated below:

- **HAL** is the Hardware Abstraction Layer, providing driver functionality without relying on any operating system services.  
- **RT-Thread Device Drivers** are built on top of HAL and offer a higher-level abstraction; users do not need to write interrupt service routines, making them easier to use. For a detailed comparison between HAL and RT-Thread device drivers, see [Chip Peripheral Drivers](https://docs.sifli.com/projects/sdk/v2.3/sf32lb55x/app_development/drivers.html).  
- **Middleware (components)** includes RT-Thread’s built-in software components (e.g., finsh, ulog), third-party components (under the `external` directory), and in-house components (under the `middleware` directory). Applications can use all service interfaces, including HAL, to build their software.

## Supported SoC Families

The SDK supports the following SiFli Technologies SoC families:

| SoC Family | Supported since  |
|------------|------------------|
| SF32LB52X  | v2.3.0           |
| SF32LB55X  | v2.3.0           |
| SF32LB56X  | v2.3.0           |
| SF32LB57X  | v2.5.1           |
| SF32LB58X  | v2.3.0           |

## Versioning Policy

Version numbers follow the [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/) scheme.

The version format is **MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH**, with the following increment rules:

- **MAJOR** version: incompatible API changes (e.g., v1.0.0 → v2.0.0)  
- **MINOR** version: backward-compatible new features or enhancements (e.g., v2.3.0 → v2.4.0)  
- **PATCH** version: backward-compatible bug fixes or small functional tweaks (e.g., v2.3.1 → v2.3.2)  

Each release is tagged as `vX.Y.Z`.

### Release Cadence

- **Patch releases**: as needed, typically as fast as one week  
- **Minor releases**: every 4–5 months  
- **Major releases**: once a year or longer  

### Branches

The repository contains the following branches:

- `main`: development branch where all new features and fixes land. **Not recommended** for production development.  
- `release/vX.Y`: minor release branches containing all patches for that minor version. All official releases are made from these branches (tags are placed on commits in these branches). **Recommended** for project development is either the latest release tag or the tip of the corresponding `release/vX.Y` branch.  
- Other branches: temporary or feature branches for internal development. **Not recommended** for general use.  

### Support Timeline

| Version | Release Date     | End-of-Support Date | Supported |

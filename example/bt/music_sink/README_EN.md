## Overview
<!-- Example introduction -->
This example demonstrates playing music from source devices on the local device after connecting to mobile phones and other A2DP Source devices via Bluetooth.

## Example Usage
<!-- Instructions on how to use the example, such as which hardware pins to connect to observe waveforms, compilation and flashing can reference related documentation.
For rt_device examples, the configuration switches used in this example also need to be listed, for example, PWM examples use PWM1, which needs to be enabled in the onchip menu -->

The example enables Bluetooth Inquiry scan and page scan on startup, allowing A2DP source devices like mobile phones to discover this device and initiate connections. After connection, mobile phone music can be played.
The default Bluetooth name of this device is sifli_music_sink.

### Hardware Requirements
Before running this example, you need to prepare:
+ One development board supported by this example ([Supported Platforms](#Platform_music_sink)).
+ Speakers.

    - Enable: Enable NVDS synchronous
        - Macro switch: `CONFIG_BSP_BLE_NVDS_SYNC`
        - Description: Bluetooth NVDS synchronization. When Bluetooth is configured to HCPU, BLE NVDS can be accessed synchronously, enable this option; when Bluetooth is configured to LCPU, this option needs to be disabled

### Compilation and Flashing
Switch to the example project directory and run the scons command to compile:
```c
> scons --board=eh-lb525 -j32
```
Switch to the example `project/build_xx` directory and run `uart_download.bat`, select the port as prompted to download:
```c
$ ./uart_download.bat

     Uart Download

please input the serial port num:5
```
For detailed compilation and download steps, please refer to the relevant introduction in [Quick Start](/quickstart/get-started.md).

## Expected Results
<!-- Describe the example execution results, such as which LEDs will light up, what logs will be printed, so users can determine if the example is running normally. Results can be explained step by step combined with code -->
After the example starts:
A2DP source devices like mobile phones can connect to this device and play music.
